## Competition Level Insights

### Performance Trends
1. **C5 (Low Competition):** Consistent high performance across all reward functions
2. **C10 (Medium Competition):** Moderate but significant improvements
3. **C15 (High Competition):** Variable performance with PWS and GU excelling

### Reward Function Effectiveness by Competition

| Competition Level | Best Performing | Runner-up | Observation |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| **C5** | Gross Utility (712.4%) | Penalty Wasted Spend (701.0%) | Close performance |
| **C10** | Gross Utility (344.7%) | Net Utility (336.8%) | More conservative gains |
| **C15** | Penalty Wasted Spend (960.2%) | Gross Utility (913.5%) | High variability advantage |

### Baseline Performance Degradation
As competition increases, baseline (truthful) performance decreases:
- **C5:** 1,496.92 net utility
- **C10:** 1,178.17 net utility (-21.3%)
- **C15:** 738.64 net utility (-50.6%)

This suggests truthful bidding becomes increasingly suboptimal in competitive environments.
