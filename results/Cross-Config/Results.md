Key Findings:
Performance by Competition Level:
C5 (5 Competitors) - Best Overall Performance:

Gross Utility: 12,161 net utility (winner)
Net Utility: 11,703 net utility (most efficient - lowest ACOS: 0.166)
Penalty Wasted Spend: 11,990 net utility (balanced approach)
C10 (10 Competitors) - Moderate Competition:

Gross Utility: 5,240 net utility (slight winner)
Net Utility: 5,146 net utility (very close performance)
Penalty Wasted Spend: 3,646 net utility (significantly lower)
C15 (15 Competitors) - High Competition:

Penalty Wasted Spend: 7,831 net utility (winner in high competition!)
Gross Utility: 7,486 net utility (second)
Net Utility: 4,944 net utility (third)
Competition Impact Insights:
Performance Degradation: As competition increases from C5 â†’ C10, performance drops significantly (50-70% reduction), but C15 shows interesting recovery patterns.

Strategy Effectiveness Changes:

Low Competition (C5): Gross Utility dominates
Medium Competition (C10): Net Utility and Gross Utility perform similarly
High Competition (C15): Penalty Wasted Spend becomes most effective
ACOS Efficiency:

Best ACOS: Net Utility in C15 (0.150) - most cost-efficient
Highest ACOS: Gross Utility in C15 (0.253) - most aggressive spending

Strategic Recommendations:
For Low Competition Markets: Use Gross Utility reward function for maximum performance
For Medium Competition Markets: Net Utility and Gross Utility are both viable, choose based on risk tolerance
For High Competition Markets: Penalty Wasted Spend becomes the optimal strategy, providing better performance than pure utility approaches
The analysis reveals that reward function effectiveness is highly dependent on competitive environment, with more conservative strategies (PWS) becoming advantageous as competition intensifies.
